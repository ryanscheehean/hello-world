# hello-world

Some of the significant features of my project, which is a website for the restaurant Luc Lac, includes a minified 
version of my css code, the index page, and the photo that goes with it. I've implemented a CSS only drop down menu 
to experiment with the types of animation and transition capabilities that CSS has by default while also ensuring that 
the website is fully functional regardless of the viewport. As it stands, it's a fully responsive and capabale website that, 
with a little more work, could be developed into a full fledged site ready for use!
